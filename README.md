# N-back!

This is the N-back game mentioned in a [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/magazine/can-you-make-yourself-smarter.html?pagewanted=all).
It might make you smart if you play it, it might have no bearing whatsoever on
your intelligence! Either way, the studies are interesting and the game is fun!

## How to play

The idea of this game is to remember where the light was _n_ turns ago and
click a button if the light is on the same spot as it was _n_ turns ago. You
have to remember _n_ turns back! _n_ can be any value, the higher the value
the harder the game tends to be. This game is currently 2-back.

You can test out the current code and play a few games [here!](http://ggnextmap.github.com/N-back/)

### Example:

First, the light is on the top right. Then the light goes to the
bottom left corner. Then the light goes back to the top right and since it was 
there two turns ago, you push the button and get a point! Nice!

    x x o      x x x      x x o  <-- Push the button!
    x x x  ->  x x x  ->  x x x
    x x x      o x x      x x x


# Looking to contribute?
Awesome! Just checkout the issues and see if you can solve any of them. 

Non-programmer issues:

* There should also be sound in this game! I need sound clips of the English
  alphabet. I also see an opportunity to make this game international!
* The design is pretty terrible. If you want to design something, I'd be happy
  to put it up!
* Feedback about the game play.
