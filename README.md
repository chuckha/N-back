# N-back!

## How to play

The idea of this game is to remember where the light was _n_ turns ago and
click a button if the light is on the same spot as it was _n_ turns ago. You
have to remember _n_ turns back! _n_ can be any value, the higher the value
the harder the game tends to be. This game is currently 2-back.

### Example:

The first board, the light is on the top right. Then the light goes to the
bottom left corner. The light the flashes to the top right and since it was 
there two turns ago, you push the button!

    x x o      x x x      x x o  <-- Push the button!
    x x x  ->  x x x  ->  x x x
    x x x      o x x      x x x
